## Branches
Create a seperate branch for every feature you are working on.
For example you are working on database connection, call your branch `db-connection`

When you are done implementing the feature merge your branch with main.
1. make sure to pull the latest changes to main
2. merge main into your branch (not the other way around)

If you want to save yourself a lot of merging work, merge with main occasionally if you are working on a branch for a while.

When this is done create a pull request on github for your branch to be merged into main, if you completed the previous step correctly,
github will tell you that your branch has no conflicts. Wait for someone to accept the pull request
